# CytokineProfile Shiny Application <a href="https://shinyinfo.cytokineprofile.org/"><img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height="134" alt="CytokineProfileShiny App website" /></a>

The goal of CytokineProfile Shiny is to conduct quality control using biological
meaningful cutoff on raw measured values of cytokines. Specifically, test on 
distributional symmetry to suggest the adopt of transformation. 
Conduct exploratory analysis including summary statistics, generate enriched 
barplots, and boxplots. Further, conduct univariate analysis and 
multivariate analysis for advance analysis. It provides an overall user-friendly
experience for users to conduct analyses on their own data. For advanced users, 
the CytoProfile R package is available on [Github](https://github.com/saraswatsh/CytoProfile) and 
at [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=CytoProfile).

The Shiny application is available at [CytokineProfile Shiny App](https://saraswatsh-cytokineprofileshiny.share.connect.posit.cloud).

## Application Workflow

The app is structured as a multi-step wizard: 

### Step 1: Data Upload

* File Input: Upload your own data file (CSV, TXT, Excel). 
  * For Excel files, choose the desired sheet. 
* Built-in Data: Choose from built-in data sets.

### Step 2: Column Selection and Filtering

* Column Selection: Choose the columns to analyze.
* Filter Data: Apply filters to categorical variables.

### Step 3: Analysis Options

* Select Analysis Function: Choose from a variety of analysis functions.
* Configure Options: Adjust parameters based on the selected analysis.
* Output Mode: Choose between interactive results display or downloadable reports.

### Step 4: Analysis Results

* Results Display: The analysis results are rendered dynamically. Depending on the selected function, results may include plots (2D/3D), tables, and even downloadable reports.
* Download Option: If the download mode is selected, the output file (PDF) is generated and made available for download 
after re-running the analysis.
