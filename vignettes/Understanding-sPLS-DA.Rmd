## Sparse Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (sPLS-DA)

Sparse Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (sPLS-DA) is a supervised multivariate method that projects samples into new components that best separate predefined groups while selecting a small set of discriminative variables (features). This page shows how to interpret the main figures produced by the app and how to reproduce them.

## Example Results: CD3/CD28 Treatment

For this brief interpretation tutorial, we will use the results generated using the CD3/CD28 treatment condition from the `ExampleData1` dataset built into the application. The groups compared in this example are Non-diabetic (ND), Pre-Diabetic (PreT2D), and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D).

### 2D Component Scores (Classification) Plot

![](../man/figures/splsda_results_Page_1.png)

This plot shows us the classification of the groups chosen for comparison. Generally, we would look for any clustering or separation of the groups. Ellipses seen in this figure are based on a 95% confidence region, so there may be overlap however less overlap suggests better discrimination. A better way to see discrimination would be to use the option for `shaded background prediction`, however it takes a bit longer due to computational time. The axis labels show the variance explained by the component 1 in the x-axis (39% in this example) and component 2 in the y-axis (33% in this example). 
The title of the plot displays the model accuracy which can provide a surface level view of the classification done by the model. In our case the model accuracy is 55.6% in classifying the three different groups which is not great as it is almost by chance. An accuracy of &ge; 70% is generally acceptable as it shows good discrimination. 


### Loadings Plot - Component 1

![](../man/figures/splsda_results_Page_4.png)

The loadings plot show the variables driving the separation along the first component. The loadings plot show the magnitude of the loadings (seen by the sacle at the bottom). The signs, whether negative or positive are of direction relative to the component's score and should not be interpreted as a p-value would and should be interpreted as to how strong the contribution of those features are in the model. To make interpretation easy, we can think about taking the absolute value of the loadings, for example in our plot we see that cytokine IFN-G has a magnitude of -0.3. Based on this, the |-0.3| magnitude would be 0.3 which would still make it the cytokine with the strongest contribution to the model associated with T2D. Similarly, cytokine IL-31 is the 3rd strongest contributor to the model associated with PreT2D group with a magnitude of 0.2. 

### Variable Importance in Projection (VIP) Scores - Component 1

![](../man/figures/splsda_results_Page_5.png)

VIP scores are another way to measure the most influential cytokines in the model. Once again, we can see the same cytokines that we saw in the loadings plot as the stronger contributors to have high VIP scores. A general rule of thumb is that variables with VIP scores > 1 are considered to be the most influential (Tenenhaus 1998), which are used for a second sPLS-DA model to determine if the classification is improved. The secondary model is ommitted from this tutorial. 

### Reciever Operator Characteristc (ROC) Curve and Area Under the Curve (AUC) 

![](../man/figures/splsda_results_Page_2.png)

The ROC curve and AUC value is a great way to evaluate the model's performance as the curve plots the true positive rate (sensitivity) against the false positive rate (1-specificity). The AUC value provides a single measure of a model's ability to discriminate between classes, with values closer to 1 indicating better performance.
In our example, the comparison of PreT2D vs Others shows us the best discrimination of the model with an AUC value of 0.8. 

### Cross-Validation Performance

![](../man/figures/splsda_results_Page_3.png)

The sPLS-DA method in the application offers two different types of cross-validation methods; Leave-One-Out (LOOCV) and M-fold cross-validation. These methods are also used to evaluate the performance of the model alongside the ROC curve and AUC as sPLS-DA is prone to overfitting especially when working with small sample size and large number of variables. 

Difference between LOOCV and M-fold cross-validation: 

* LOOCV: This method involves training the model on all data points except one, and then testing it on that single left-out data point. This process is repeated for every data point, and the results are averaged. LOOCV is computationally intensive but provides a nearly unbiased estimate of the model's performance, especially useful for small datasets.

* M-fold Cross-Validation: In M-fold cross-validation (e.g., 5-fold or 10-fold), the dataset is randomly divided into M equally sized subsets (folds). The model is trained on M-1 folds and validated on the remaining fold. This process is repeated 100 times, with each fold serving as the validation set exactly once. The results from each fold are then averaged to produce a single performance estimate. 

In our exmaple, we can see that the LOOCV error rate is plotted across the first 2 components. The error rate is the rate of misclassification in the model which in our case LOOCV shows an error rate of  approximately 49.5%. This is can be also reworded as, LOOCV shows us an accuracy of 50.5%, which is similar to our overall model accuracy that we saw earlier in the 2D classification plot.
